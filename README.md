# How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?
Interpreting user needs involves understanding what the end user values and translating these into specific functionalities within a program. User stories play a central role in this process, as they provide a concise way to capture and communicate what the user needs and why. Writing user stories allows developers to prioritize features based on user value and ensures the program aligns with the user's expectations and business goals. User stories also keep development user-focused, helping teams stay agile and flexible as new needs arise.

# How do I approach developing programs? What Agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?
When developing programs, I start by breaking down the requirements into smaller, manageable taks, often represented as user stories or tasks within a sprint. I find that Agile processes, particularly Scrum practices like sprint planning, standups, and retrospectives, provide a structured yet flexible framework for managing development. In future work, I aim to incorporate iterative developement and continuous feedback loops, as these allow for faster adjustments based on user feedback, helping to create a more responsive and user-centered product.

# What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?
Being a good team member in software development means actively contributing to both the project and the team dynamic. It involves clear and open communication, collaboration and a willingness to support others. Good team members bring their technical skills while also fostering an environment of respect and adaptability. They prioritize the team's success over individual accomplishments and remain open to constuctive feedback, embracing it as an opportunity for improvement.
